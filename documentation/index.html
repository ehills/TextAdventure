    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This is our user guide for our adaptation of BIFF</p>
    <p>We have ensured no verbs are hardcoded to give the user more control over their game. We have also made it possible that every word in the game can be defined by the user so that a game could be written for any language. Check out the example game at the end to see how everything works.</p>

    <h2>Language Constructs</h2>
    <h3>CREATE THE PLAYER IN THE GAME</h3>
    <p>Note: Create only one player per game.</p>

    <code> 
    // This creates a player called sam with a carry limit of 5.
    Player sam {
        carryLimit = 5; // carryLimit must be set.
    }
    </code>

    <h3>CREATE A LOCATION IN THE GAME</h3>
    <p>Note: north, south, east and west are set to NULL if not defined. Also if a location is defined as north, south, east or west that location has to be created..</p>

    <code> 
    // This creates a location called myBedrooom with a hallway to the west and toilet to the east.    
    // There are no locations to the north and south.
    Location myBedroom { // This needs to be unique.
        name = "bedroom"; // The name of myBedroom that you see in game. Name must be set.
        description = "My bedroom is messy as always"; // Description must be set.
        west = hallway; // Setting north, south, east and west is optional.
        east = toilet;
    }
    </code>

    <h3>CREATE AN ITEM IN THE GAME</h3>
    <p>Note: Be careful not to have items with the same name in the same location.</p>

    <code> 
    // This creates an item called wrench which is set to sam's inventory. 
    // It also has attributes to be dropped and picked up.
    Item wrench { // This needs to be unique.
        name = "wrench"; // The name of the item in game. Name must be set.
        description = "Your trusty wrench."; // Description must be set.
        location = sam; // The wrench will start in sam's inventory. Location must be set.
        hasAttributes = canPickup canDrop; // The wrench can be picked up and dropped. hasAttributes is optional.
    }
    </code>

    <p> The actions taken with a given verb is also defined inside an Item. <a href="#verbs">go to Verb section</a></p>

    <h3>CREATE AN ITEM IN THE GAME</h3>
    <p>Note: Be careful not to have items with the same name in the same location.</p>

    <code> 
    // This creates an item called wrench which is set to sam's inventory. 
    // It also has attributes to be dropped and picked up.
    Item wrench { // This needs to be unique.
        name = "wrench"; // The name of the item in game. Name must be set.
        description = "Your trusty wrench."; // Description must be set.
        location = sam; // The wrench will start in sam's inventory. Location must be set.
        hasAttributes = canPickup canDrop; // The wrench can be picked up and dropped. hasAttributes is optional.
    }
    </code>

    <p> The actions taken with a given verb is also defined inside an Item.</p>
    
    <h3>ONE WORD USER COMMAND AND LOCATION DEFAULT VERBS</h3>
	<p>The one word command is used for global verbs to be used in every location like: "north", "south", "east", "west", "quit", "inventory", "look". This feature is implemented inside LocationDefaults.</p>
	
	<code> 
    // eg. command = n
    LocationDefaults {
            Verb "north or n or nth" {
                /*
                 * rules go here
                 * If the rules are set correctly the the player will move north.
                 */
            } 
    }

    // eg. User command = i
    LocationDefaults {
        Verb "i or inventory or inv" {
                /*
                 * rules go here
                 * If the rules are set correctly the player's inventory will be shown.
                 */
        } 
    }
    </code>

    <h3>TWO WORD USER COMMAND AND ITEM DEFAULT VERBS (VERB NOUN PATTERN)</h3>
    <p>The two word command pattern is used to do stuff like: "get wrench", "open door", "drop wrench", "use lamp" etc. This feature is implemented while defining
an item's verb or inside ItemDefaults.</p>
    <code>
    // eg. User command = get key
    Item Key {
        Verb "get or pickup" {
            // get or pickup the key.
        } 
    }

    // eg. User command = look
    ItemDefaults {
        Verb "examine or x or look" {
            // All items in the game will have this verb.
        }
    }
    </code>

    <h3>FOUR WORD USER COMMAND AND ITEM DEFAULT VERBS (VERB NOUN JOIN NOUN PATTERN)</h3>
    <p>The four word command pattern is used to do stuff like: "put key into box". This feature is implemented while defining an item's verb or inside ItemDefaults
by using the keyword "Join:" for the join word and synonyms, and "Item: to specify the second noun in the sentence".</p>
    <code>
    // eg. User command = put key into box
    Item key {
        Verb "put or place Join: into or in or inside Item: box" {
             // Put or place the key into or in or inside the box.
        }
    }

    //eg. User command = put key into box
    ItemDefaults {
        Verb "take or get Join: from Item: box" {
            // All items in the game will have this verb and join command.
        }
    } 
    </code>

    <h3>SYNONYMS</h3>
    <p>We have implemented synonyms differently to BIFF. The user need only use "or" between verbs to write as many synonyms as they want.</p>
    <code>
    // North, n, and nth all refer to the same verb.
    Verb "north or n or nth" {}.
    </code>

    <h3>ATTRIBUTES</h3>
    <p>Item attributes are initialised during the creation of an item. These attributes are either true or false. False is indicated by having an '!' at the start of the attribute. The user can write as many attributes for an item as they want by using a space between them. Unlike BIFF we saw no reason to have global attributes because if an item does not have an attribute, it is set to false by default. Item attributes are used in verbs to allow items to be used in certain ways.</p>
    <code>
    // The door is closed but not locked.
    Item door {
        hasAttributes = isClosed !islocked;
    } 
    </code>

    <h3>COMMENTS</h3>
    <p>Single line comments // and block comments /* */ can be used in the gamefile.</p>
    <code>
    // Single line comment
    
    /*
        This is
        a
        multiline   
        comment
    */
    </code>
