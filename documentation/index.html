    <h1>Text adventure documentation</h1>
    <p>By Samuel Garner, George Phillips, Stephen Herd and Edward Hills</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This is our user guide for our adaptation of BIFF - Basic interactive fiction format.</p>

    <h2>Pleasant suprises</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Games can now be saved or restored. A game can be saved anytime during the game to slots 0-9 and restored when the game is loaded up from slots 0-9. 
	  A game will only start with the choice to restore or start a new game if there is atleast one saved game, otherwise, the game will start a new game automatically.</li>
      <li>We have designed our language so that all verbs must be defined by the user, which means no verbs are hardcoded. This allows the nicety of being able to apply rules/logic to every verb in the game.</li>
	  <li>We have made it possible that every word in the game can be defined by the user, so that a game can be written for any language.</li>
	  <li>If a user wants a NPC (non-player character) in their game, it can be created and defined using an item object like so:
	    <code>
    // NPC creation using an item object.
    Item shopkeeper {
        name = "shopkeeper";
        description = "This shopkeeper looks dodgy.";
        location = shop;
        Verb "talk" {rules here}
    }
	    </code>
	  </li>
	  <li>If a user wants to override an ItemDefaults' verb with an Item's verb, all the user need do is set the Item's verb string to be identical to that of the ItemDefaults's verb string 
	  they wish to override like so:
	    <code>
    // You pick up the item using ItemDefaults.   
    ItemDefaults {
        Verb "pickup or get" {rules} 
    }
    // You cannont pick up the wrench if the rules are set for that using an Item verb. This takes precedence over ItemDefaults.
    Item wrench {
        Verb "pickup or get" {rules} 
    }
	    </code>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Check out the example game at the end to see how everything works.</p>
	
	<h2>How to install the game parser</h2>    
	<p>To compile the game parser which builds a game file, run the following command: </p>
	<code> 
    // On Mac or Linux from the TextAdventure directory
    make
    </code>
	<code> 
    // On Windows from the TextAdventure directory
    nmake
	</code>
	
	<h2>How to build a game</h2>    
	<p>To build a game you simply pipe the file to the compiled TextAdventure compiler like so: </p>
    <code> 
    // On Mac or Linux from the TextAdventure directory
    ./TextAdventure games/haunted_mansion.txt
    </code>
	<code> 
    // On Windows from the TextAdventure directory
    TextAdventure games/haunted_mansion.txt
    </code>
    <p>This will Generate a C++ file in the output folder where the other necessary files are already placed.</p>

	<h2>How to install a game</h2>    
	<p>After generating the game file, run the following commands to compile and run the game: </p>
	<code>
    // On Mac or Linux from the TextAdventure directory
    cd output
    make
    ./Play
    </code>
	<code>
    // On Windows from the TextAdventure directory
    cd output
    nmake
    play
    </code>
	
    <p>This uses a preconfigured MakeFile to compile using g++ (g++ is our default compiler) the C++ files along with the necessary classes.</p>
    <p>To distribute the game just send the "Play" file to the desired destination.</p>
    
	<h2>Makefiles</h2>
	<p>We have supplied makefiles for the g++ compiler and the cl compiler which are found in /TextAdventure/makefiles/. There are two makefiles 
	required to install our program, one to compile the parser which goes in /TextAdventure/ and one to compile the game file which 
	goes in /TextAdventure/output/. To change makefiles to a different compiler simply choose the compiler you wish to 
	use from the makefiles directory and copy/paste the two makefiles into their corresponding directories.</p>
    
	<h2>Language constructs</h2>
	
    <h3>Syntax that resembles standard C</h3>
    <p>Our little language's syntax closely resembles that of standard C syntax.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Player, Location, Item, ItemDefaults, LocationDefaults, Verb, if and else statements need to start with an opening brace and finish 
	    with a closing brace like so:
		<code>
    Player sam {Player variables go here}
    Location hallway {Location variables go here}
    Item book {Item variables and two word (verb noun) or four word (verb noun join noun) verbs go here}
    Verb "run" {Verb rules go here}
    ItemDefaults {two word (verb noun) or four word (verb noun join noun) verbs go here}
    LocationDefaults {single word verbs go here}
    if(condition goes here){rules go here}else{rules go here}
        </code>
	  </li>
	  <li>Variable assignment is done with the '=' operator like so:
	    <code>
    name = "book";
    description = "An old book.";
    location = hallway;
        </code>
	  </li>
	  <li>All statements must start on a newline, end with a semicolon and there must be only one statement per line like so:
	    <code>
    initialLocation = hallway;
    print "You open the door.";
    hallway setDescription "The hallway of your house.";
        </code>
	  </li>
	  <li>If statements must have a conditional that will evaluate to either true or false inside open and closed brackets like so:
	    <code>
    if (currentLocation hasNorth) {rules go here}
    if (currentLocation hasItem key) {rules go here}
    if (wrench inLocation sam) {rules go here}
        </code>
	  </li>
	  <li>A string needs to be enclosed in quotes like so:
        <code>
    print "Hi there."; // String Hi there. is enclosed in quotes.
    Verb "get or pickup" // Verb string needs to be enclosed in quotes.
        </code>
	  </li>
	  <li>Objects are referenced using their variable name like so:
        <code>
    location = hallway; // hallway is the name of a Location object.
    if (book inLocation sam) // book is the name of an Item object and sam is the name of a Player object.
        </code>
	  </li>
	  <li>If and else statements can be nested like so:
	    <code>
    if (sam inLocation hallway) {
        if(door hasAttribute isLocked) {
            if(key inLocation sam) {
                print "You unlock the door.";
            } else {
                print "You do not have the key.";
            }
        } else {
            print "The door is already open";
        }
    } else {
        print "You don't know how to do that here.";
    }
		</code>
	  </li>   
	  <li>Single line comments // and block comments /* */ can be used like so:
	    <code>
    // Single line comment
    
    /*
        This is a
        multiline   
        comment
    */
       </code> 
	  </li>
	   <li>Can only use single quotes inside strings and not double quotes. Double quotes will cause a bug which will finish the string at the second set of double quotes.
	    <code>
    gameName = "This game is 'cool'...";
       </code> 
	  </li>
      <li>When creating a Player, Location or Item object, you must follow the type with a unique identifier like so:
		<p>Note: Item and location unique identifiers cannot be the same, as items are treated as locations in a game.</p>
		<code>
    Player uniqueID {Player variables go here}
    Location uniqeID {Location variables go here}
    Item uniqueID {Item variables go here}
		</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
	
	<h3>Syntax unique to our language</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>When a Verb is first created it must immediately be followed by a string defining the verb or verbs that refer to it.
	    <code>
    Verb "eat" {rules} // Verb string is "eat".
    Verb "north or n or nth" {rules} // Verb string is "north or n or nth".
		</code>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Create the player in the game</h3>
    <p>Note: Create only one player per game.</p>
	  <code> 
    // This creates a player called sam with a carry limit of 5.
    Player sam {
        carryLimit = 5; // carryLimit must be set.
    }
     </code>

    <h3>Create the location in the game</h3>
    <p>Note: north, south, east and west are set to NULL if not defined. Also if a location is defined as north, south, east or west that location has to be created.</p>

    <code> 
    // This creates a location called myBedrooom with a hallway to the west and toilet to the east.    
    // There are no locations to the north and south.
    Location myBedroom { // This needs to be unique.
        name = "bedroom"; // The name of myBedroom that you see in game. Name must be set.
        description = "My bedroom is messy as always"; // Description must be set.
        west = hallway; // Setting north, south, east and west is optional.
        east = toilet;
        hideItems; // The items in the bedroom are hidden. Locations are set to showItems by default so this is optional.
    }
    </code>

    <h3>Create an item in the game</h3>
    <p>Note: Be careful not to have items with the same name in the same location.</p>

    <code> 
    // This creates an Item object box, which is in the hallway. 
    // It also has an attribute to isOpen.
    Item box{ // This needs to be unique.
        name = "box"; // The name of the item in game. Name must be set.
        description = "A big box."; // Description must be set.
        location = hallway; // The box is in the hallway.
        // Note hasAttributes' value is not enclosed in quotes.
        hasAttributes = isOpen; // The box isOpen. hasAttributes is optional.
        hideItems; // The items in the box are hidden. Items are set to showItems by default so this is optional.
        
        // Item verbs defined within the Item object here
        Verb "open" {rules} // Open the box. User command = open box
        Verb "push" {rules} // Push the box. User command = push box
    }
    </code>
   
    <h3>Verb rules</h3>
	<p>All rules/logic are performed within a Verb by using if or if else statements, else if statements are not supported. These logical operators 
	are not supported: AND (&#38;&#38;), OR (||), XOR (^) and NOT (!). This means only one condition can be used per if statement, however the language
	allows as many if else statements to be nested as required.</p>
	
	<h3>One word user command and location default verbs</h3>
	<p>The one word command is used as a global verb, which can be used in every location like: "north", "south", "east", "west", "quit", "inventory", "look". This feature is implemented inside LocationDefaults.</p>
	
	<code> 
    // User command = n
    LocationDefaults {
            Verb "north or n or nth" {
                /*
                 * rules go here
                 * If the rules are set correctly the the player will move north.
                 */
            } 
    }

    // User command = i
    LocationDefaults {
        Verb "i or inventory or inv" {
                /*
                 * rules go here
                 * If the rules are set correctly the player's inventory will be shown.
                 */
        } 
    }
    </code>

    <h3>Two word user command and item default verbs (verb noun pattern)</h3>
    <p>The two word command pattern is used to do stuff like: "get wrench", "open door", "drop wrench", "use lamp" etc. This feature is implemented while defining
an item's verb or inside ItemDefaults.</p>
    <code>
    // User command = get key
    Item Key {
        Verb "get or pickup" { // get or pickup the key.
        } 
    }

    // User command = look inputItem  // inputItem can be any item in the game.
    ItemDefaults {
        Verb "examine or x or look" { // All items in the game will have this verb.
        }
    }
    </code>

    <h3>Four word user command and item default verbs (verb noun join noun pattern)</h3>
    <p>The four word command pattern is used to do stuff like: "put key into box". This feature is implemented while defining an item's verb or inside ItemDefaults
by using the keyword "Join:" for the join word and synonyms, and "Item: to specify the second noun in the sentence".</p>
    <code>
    // User command = put key into box
    Item key {
        Verb "put or place Join: into or in or inside Item: box" { // Put or place the key into or in or inside the box.
        }
    }

    // User command = take key from box
    ItemDefaults {
        Verb "take or get Join: from Item: box" { // All items in the game will have this verb and join command.
        }
    } 
    </code>

    <h3>Synonyms</h3>
    <p>We have implemented synonyms differently to BIFF. The user need only use "or" between verbs to write as many synonyms as they want.</p>
    <code>
    // North, n, and nth all refer to the same verb.
    Verb "north or n or nth" {}.
    </code>

    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <p>Item attributes are initialised during the creation of an item. These attributes are either true or false. False is indicated by having an '!' at the start of the attribute. The user can write as many attributes for an item as they want by using a space between them. Unlike BIFF we saw no reason to have global attributes because if an item does not have an attribute, it is set to false by default. Item attributes are used in verbs to allow items to be used in certain ways.</p>
    <code>
    // The door is closed but not locked.
    Item door {
        hasAttributes = isClosed !islocked;
    } 
    </code>

	<h2>Known Bugs</h2>   
	<p>If 'or' is used as a verb it will cause an error even though 'or' is not a verb. This can be easily fixed later on.</p>
	<p>Can only use single quotes inside strings and not double quotes. Double quotes will cause a bug which will finish 
	the string at the second set of double quotes.</p>
	
	<h2>Future development plans</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Improve error checking.</li>
		<li>Add feature for count items.</li>
		<li>Add feature to save and restore a game.</li>
